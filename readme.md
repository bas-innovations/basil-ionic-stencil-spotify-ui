This is a Spotify Clone (user interface only) built in ionic 5 and stenciljs.  No frameworks such as angular have been used.

It is based on Simon Grimm's tutorial which heavily relies on angular.  You can watch that awesome tutorial on [youtube](https://youtu.be/sdrw15el3_w).

Simon Grimm's tutorial was in turn based on Caleb Nance's react spotify clone which you can find on [github](https://github.com/calebnance/expo-spotify).
